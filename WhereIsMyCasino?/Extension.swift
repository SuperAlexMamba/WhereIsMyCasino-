let newOne = News(title: "Mark Cuban’s Mavericks Sale To Adelson Family Motivated By Plans For Dallas Casino-Resort Project",
                  description: "The decision of Mark Cuban to officially sell his large stake in the NBA’s Dallas Mavericks to the Adelson family brings his long-held idea to the fore.New proposal:According to his pitch, the proposal refers to an alliance with casino mogul Dr. Miriam Adelson and Las Vegas Sands Corp. owned by her family, to construct a new casino-resort in Dallas whose main attraction would be the new arena for the aforementioned team. However, the condition for this is the official legalization of gambling in Texas. Commenting on the proposal, Cuban said to the Dallas Morning News: “Texas is such an amazing state that we need to be a destination. And this is the way to do it.”Moreover, in addition to him, one more person sees uncommon potential in the idea. The person is David Cordish, the president and chief executive officer of Cordish Cos., developer of the famous Texas Live entertainment complex in Arlington, located next to the Texas Rangers’ Globe Life Field. In this regard, commenting in an email  when asked about the proposed casino-resort project of the aforementioned Cuban when asked, he said: “The idea of combining entertainment and mixed use around a casino is absolutely the winning formula.”In addition, he added, according to the Dallas Business Journal: “I don’t have enough information to comment on the specifics of Cuban’s plans in Dallas, but he has had success with similar concepts across the nation. My  company previously used this formula when it developed two Hard Rock casinos with hotels in Florida, two of the most successful casinos in America. My company has also developed casino/entertainment complexes in Maryland, Philadelphia and Pittsburgh and those created spectacular and transformative results in those areas.”The location is still unclear:As for the location, it stays hazy where the aforementioned proposed project in Dallas would be located. In this regard, commenting on the possible location, Zarin Gracey, a member of the Dallas City Council, said to the NBC 5: “It should be next to the future redevelopment of the Dallas Convention Center, a nearly $3 billion project in its own right.”However, also commenting on a location, Cuban said to the Morning News: “There’s no reason why we can’t build a huge resort destination in the city proper of Dallas. There’s plenty of places to do it.”Far from reality:At Chase’s Make Your Move Summit, Cuban expressed his wish for a casino-centered resorts to be located in Texas. However, the fact that Cuban is ready to accept casino gaming at resorts in the said state is a long way from reality because of a lengthy history of anti-industry lawmakers together with a nascent sports wagering market. On a related note, in order for casino games to be validated in Texas, a constitutional amendment is demanded, which would have to receive a minimum of two-thirds votes of the aforementioned lawmakers, meaning that 21 out of a total of 30 senators would have to validate the change.Also, sports wagering and the casino industry are struggling to “find favor“ with Texas lawmakers, Texas Lieutenant Governor Dan Patrick said, according to Covers.com.One more reason Cuban’s wish is so far from reality is that Texas residents will need to wait till 2025 to see any chance of being able to use sports wagering and casino gaming, since the state’s legislature just meets in odd-numbered years. Primarily because of this, gambling firms continue to bypass the opportunity-rich market of 30 million inhabitants.",

let newTwo = News(title: "Third Stage of NSW Compliance Program Begins, Venues Warned About Zero-Tolerance",
                  description: "Since the Liquor & Gaming NSW (L&GNSW) launched its new compliance program related to displaying gaming signage at various venues, a lot changed – but there’s a lot more to be done as well. The third stage has just begun, and now there will be zero tolerance when it comes to this rule.Strict rules:L&GNSW is pretty strict when it comes to complying with the new laws. Among the recent actions is banning two venues from displaying the new signages that resembled electronic gaming machines, even though the machines themselves weren’t displayed.Since December 1, strict measures have been taken against anyone who displays the signage, including everything related to gaming, both internal and external, if it can be visible from outside.The Royal Hotel at Granville promoted its restaurant ‘Mr Choy’s Wok’ using a cartoon picture that resembled the ‘Choy’s Kingdom’ electronic gaming machine. The signage was removed by L&GNSW, but the hotel submitted an appeal on this decision.The Stardust Hotel at Cabramatta displayed an image of a panda with a branch or plant that resembled the ‘Panda Magic’ electronic gaming machine, so the picture had to be removed as well.David Harris, a Minister for Gaming and Racing, said that the regulatory body won’t accept any delays when it comes to the removal of the signage, regardless of the reason. He claimed: “Any signage that attempts to circumvent the prohibition on gambling-related signage will be met with an escalated enforcement response. This includes the use of animations, symbols or characters commonly associated with gambling, poker machine graphics or gambling franchises.”The ban started in September, and the authority’s inspectors have already visited more than 1.200 venues in 54 local government areas in the state. This is more than 55% of venues that have already been visited, among the ones that possess licenses for operating the gaming machines. The compliance rate was 99%.Harris added: “By now, venue operators should have a full understanding of the requirements, and all illegal signage should be removed. Removing this signage is just one important part of our commitment to gambling reform to reduce harm and tackle money laundering head-on in NSW.”The new regulations:The venues that don’t comply with the new regulations about the signage can pay huge penalties. The maximum penalty for violating the Gaming Machines Act is $11.000 per offense, along with disciplinary action.The NSW Government began changing the regulations in March, and since then, various measures have been conducted, including reducing the cash input limit, reducing the cap on gaming machine entitlements, banning political donations, and establishing a new independent panel to take care of trials of cashless gaming in New South Wales.",

                  description: "Financial Services Bureau of the city of Macau released on 16 November 2023 the data on the financial impact of the Macau gaming industry on the governmental operations. According to the Bureau, the Macau government collected MOP51.55 billion (US$6.42 billion) in gaming tax revenues from January through October 2023, GGRAsia reports.US$ 6.42 Billion Tax Revenues:According to the source, the tax revenue performance for the first ten month of 2023 arrived at the 215.7% higher level than the same period in 2022. As reported, the year 2022 featured the Covid-19 -associated travel restrictions that heavily affected the city’s gaming industry. The growth coincided with the January 8, 2023 opening of the gambling properties after an extended period of closures. The market has taken a giant steps to recover ever since and the rapid growth has been reflected in the both the gross gaming and tax revenues bringing the long-awaited relief to the stakeholders.October Revenues Decline:But the recovery pace is still a winding road as the monthly figures go up and down depending on the seasons of customer arrivals from either overseas or mainland China. Therefore the Macau tax administration collected slightly above MOP5.78 billion (US$720 million) in gaming tax revenues in October to record a 13.1 % decline in comparison with the preceding month.But GGRAsia reports that the revenue figures reached in a month are not directly comparable to the figures reported by the city’s tax authorities for the same month. The discrepancy is reportedly due to the fact that the gross gaming revenues recorded in a month are typically registered in the Macau tax system at a later time when the tax is paid.Best Annual Performance in August:For this reason, the Macau’s September gross gaming revenue showed a similar trend in October and September as both months recorded a 13.2 % decline when compered with the preceding month. Therefore the city casinos generated around MOP14.94 billion (US$1.86 billion) in September while the revenue level of MOP17.21 billion (US$2.14 billion) reached in August still represents the second-highest monthly revenue in 2023, according to GGRAsia.The same source reports that the gross gaming revenue for the ten months to 31 October 2023 reached MOP148.45 billion (US$18.48 billion), which is more than three times higher than the same period in 2022. As a consequence, the respective tax revenues have already arrived  at 101.4% of the MOP50.85 billion (US$6.33 billion) tax revenue figure planned by the Macau government’s for the entire year 2023.The tax revenue result achieved for the ten months has also been driven by the new gaming tax introduced within the scope of a new 10-year gaming concession system. The regulation having been effective from January 1, 2023  reportedly imposes a 40% tax on gross gaming revenues to record MOP51.55 billion (US$6.42 billion) in gaming tax revenues from January through October 2023.",

                    description: "Nevada’s Gaming Control Board revealed that the state gambling industry generated more than $1.31 billion in gross gaming revenues in October 2023 to set another monthly gaming revenue record. As reported, the October revenue represents a 2.7 increase when compared to October 2022.$1.31 Billion Record:According to the Nevada Independent, the record hit in October stands for the sixth-highest single month revenue level. The Las Vegas neighboring gaming markets and Reno mainly contributed to the figure, with the Las Vegas Strip generating only $714.5 million. The prestigious gaming area still recorded an increase of 1.2 percent year-over-year mainly driven by the high-end baccarat $89.8 million revenue.3.5% Ahead of 2022 Record:Michael Lawton, the control board’s senior economic analyst, reportedly said that the Strip casinos experienced a decline in slot machine revenues and sports betting for a few months after more than two years of consecutive monthly increases.  According to the source, Las Vegas markets saw a 5.7% increase in gaming revenues in October. Casinos on the Boulder Strip in Clark County (including Henderson) generated $88.6 million to see the gaming revenue increase of 10.3 percent in the same month. For the first ten months of 2023, Nevada’s gambling revenue level is already 3.5% higher than the 2022 record of $14.8 billion with the Strip recording a 5.4% total increase over the same period.5.5 Million Travelers:As the Nevada Independent reports, the record October revenues were also driven by an exceptional performance of the Harry Reid International Airport that reached a single-month record with almost 5.5 million travelers. For the first time since January 2020, the facility recorded more than 315,000 international travelers. Lawton reportedly said that  “the incredible airport passenger totals include local passengers as well” with both international and local travelers boosted the gaming figures.34.1 Million Visitors:The record number of travelers resulted in the 87.7 % occupancy rate in Las Vegas to reflect the level from the same month of 2022. But the entertainment capital of the world hosted more than 34.1 million of visitors for ten months in 2023 to report a 5.8 % increase over the same period in 2022.Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority Vice President Kevin Bagger reportedly said that the average daily hotel room rate of $233.22 and revenue per available room of $204.53 in October represent records for the Strip exceeding the previous ones set in March. As reported by the source, the occupancy rates were driven by Las Vegas Raiders home games and the performances of U2, Ed Sheeran, and Pink at the city stadiums.",
